## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose:

 - After creating a successful election audit for Seth and Tom, the election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit. Specifically they asked for the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. Using the elcetion_results_csv file once again, I will compile the data and outline the key information that they are searching for using Visual Studio and the Python language.
